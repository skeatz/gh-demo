Hi! I am Ezahan Hanafi. I am a digital fabrication specialist, DIY-er, and educator in my profession, in my personal life I am a family man and also an adventurer by heart who like to learn new things, explore and do physical activities such as OCRs and travelling.

I consider myself a "forever student" and looking for new ways to hone my skills from digital, social networking and self-improvements to stay in tune with current affairs and professional development. 

I do have a Youtube channel which houses some of my tutorial portfolios on digital fabrication, look it up here! [ EH YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY9DSwfoSC4pJ1y9O1xL5kw) If you are looking for a collaboration, reach out to me at (ezahan.hanafi@gmail.com).
