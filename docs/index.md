# Fab Academy Project Home 2023

## Hello, new visitor!

## Welcome to my Fab Academy site!

This site serves as a technical project/ assignment blog in my journey as a student in Fab Academy 2023. Please look up on the top navigation panel for the relevant links on me, my assignments and my final project!

## How to edit it

You can edit it on [Gitlab](http://gitlab.fabcloud.org). The software used turns simple text files
written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, into the site you are navigating.

No worries, you can't break anything, all the changes you make are saved under [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). This means that you have all the different versions of your page saved and available all the time in the Gitlab interface.
